Introduction: How to Build a Bionic Arm with EMG and NodeMCU
This project shows you how to build a basic bionic arm using a NodeMCU (ESP8266) and an EMG (Electromyography) sensor to detect muscle movements. When you flex your forearm muscles, the EMG sensor reads the signal and sends it to the NodeMCU. Based on this signal, a servo motor rotates to either open or close a robotic hand — mimicking natural hand motion.

This setup can be the foundation for a prosthetic arm, rehabilitation tool, or biofeedback system.

In this guide, you'll learn how to:

✅ Set up the hardware connections
✅ Install the necessary software
✅ Upload the Arduino code
✅ Calibrate and test your EMG-controlled robotic hand

Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or robotics enthusiast, this project is a great way to explore biomechanics, bio-signals, and embedded systems.

How It Works

1. **Muscle Movement Detection**:  
   The EMG sensor is placed on your forearm to detect electrical activity when you contract or relax your muscle.

2. **Signal Processing**:  
   The analog signal from the EMG sensor is read through the `A0` pin of the NodeMCU.

3. **Thresholding**:  
   If the signal exceeds a predefined threshold (indicating a muscle contraction), the NodeMCU sends a signal to the servo to rotate to 180°, simulating a **closed hand**.

4. **Debounce Timing**:  
   To prevent erratic behavior from small fluctuations or noise, a debounce delay of 2.5 seconds is used between state changes.

5. **Motor Control**:  
   A single servo motor rotates between 0° (open hand) and 180° (closed hand) based on the EMG input.

- ## 🔌 Wiring Guide

| Component         | NodeMCU Pin |
|------------------|-------------|
| EMG Vcc          | 3.3V        |
| EMG GND          | GND         |
| EMG Output       | A0          |
| Servo Signal     | D4 (GPIO2)  |
| Servo Vcc        | External 5V |
| Servo GND        | GND (common with NodeMCU) |

 ⚠️ **Note**: Do NOT power the servo directly from NodeMCU 3.3V. Use a separate 5V power supply.
